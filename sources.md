## 1️⃣ Master list of RFP / Call-for-Proposals sources

I’ll focus on sources that either:

* already show RFPs / calls for proposals, or
* clearly run recurring CFPs where vendors/consultants are brought in.

### A. Core, national-ish hubs

1. **CharityVillage – “Request for Proposal” postings**
   *What:* Exactly what you’re already using – nonprofits post RFPs as “jobs.” ([CharityVillage][1])

   * URL (RFP search in Canada):
     `https://www.charityvillage.com/jobs/request-proposal/canada`

2. **Bids&Tenders – Supplier Portal**
   *What:* Public-sector procurement, but many smaller municipalities and agencies use it; you can filter to services that match web/dev/consulting. ([bids.bidsandtenders.ca][2])

   * Vendor / opportunity portal:
     `https://bids.bidsandtenders.ca/`
   * Main info:
     `https://www.bidsandtenders.com/`

3. **CanadaBuys – Tender Opportunities (federal)**
   *What:* Often larger, but there *are* smaller digital/consulting contracts, and some community-based programs. You can filter by value, type, etc. ([CanadaBuys][3])

   * Tender opportunities:
     `https://canadabuys.canada.ca/en/tender-opportunities`

4. **(Primarily FYI) MERX** – you already know you don’t love it, but I’d keep a *light* saved search just in case a perfect oddball NP project appears. ([Merx][4])

   * `https://www.merx.com/`

---

### B. Nonprofit-specific networks & resource hubs

These don’t always have “RFP boards” but *do* regularly publish calls for proposals, research projects, digital projects, etc., via posts, PDFs, and newsletters.

5. **CharityVillage – RFP resources (for context + hints of activity)**

   * RFP best-practices article (confirms they’re used as an RFP posting hub): ([resources.charityvillage.com][5])
     `https://resources.charityvillage.com/tag/request-for-proposals/`

6. **Imagine Canada**
   *What:* Sector-wide hub (research, funding, Grant Connect). They also highlight federal and sector funding calls, like federal seniors programs, etc. ([experience.imaginecanada.ca][6])

   * Main site: `https://www.imaginecanada.ca/`
   * Grant Connect (paid, for funders; good for staying close to funders that might later issue RFPs):
     `https://www.imaginecanada.ca/en/grantconnect/learn-more`

7. **TechSoup Canada**
   *What:* Tech discounts + learning; nonprofits there are tech-minded and sometimes post or signal tech/digital initiatives that turn into vendor opportunities. ([TechSoup][7])

   * `https://www.techsoup.ca/`

8. **Ontario Nonprofit Network (ONN)**
   *What:* ONN doesn’t have a standing RFP board but periodically issues RFPs and call-for-proposal PDFs; they also advocate on procurement, so watching them keeps you close to NP procurement chatter. ([Ontario Nonprofit Network][8])

   * Main: `https://theonn.ca/`
   * Tag “procurement”: `https://theonn.ca/tag/procurement/`

9. **Vantage Point / BC Non-Profit Network (BCNN)**
   *What:* BC network with sector news, training, and sometimes project calls (especially around capacity-building, digital, strategy, etc.). ([thevantagepoint.ca][9])

   * Main: `https://thevantagepoint.ca/`
   * BC Non-Profit Network page:
     `https://thevantagepoint.ca/join/bc-nonprofit-network/`

10. **CCVO / The Nonprofit Chamber (Alberta)**
    *What:* Calgary/Alberta-focused NP chamber. Historically issues RFPs (e.g., for conferences, research) and promotes sector opportunities. ([Calgary Arts Development][10])

    * Main: `https://www.thenonprofitchamber.org/`

---

### C. Local funders (where many NP projects live)

These are *great* for small projects: digital, portals, evaluation, training, comms.

11. **United Way East Ontario – Calls for Proposals**
    *Example:* Detailed CFP guidebook for 2024; similar things pop up in future cycles and often require tech/portal/learning solutions. ([unitedwayeo.ca][11])

    * Guidebook example (to know what to look for):
      `https://www.unitedwayeo.ca/` (then Programs/Funding; or directly via published PDFs like the 2024 guide)

12. **United Way KFL&A (Kingston, Frontenac, Lennox & Addington)** – Funding page
    *What:* Publishes funding applications & notes when there are/isn’t an active call for proposals. Good template of what other UWs do. ([unitedwaykfla.ca][12])

    * `https://www.unitedwaykfla.ca/funding/`

13. **United Way Simcoe Muskoka – Reaching Home / CFPs**
    *What:* Example of a United Way managing calls for proposals on behalf of federal programs. ([uwsimcoemuskoka.ca][13])

    * `https://uwsimcoemuskoka.ca/rhinformationpage/`

You can replicate this pattern across:

* **United Way Greater Toronto** – `https://www.unitedwaygt.org/`
* **United Way British Columbia** – `https://uwbc.ca/`
* **United Way Calgary & Area** – `https://calgaryunitedway.org/`

Most have:

> “Funding”, “Grants”, or “Call for Proposals” pages.

14. **Community Foundations (local)**
    They offer grants, and sometimes RFPs for evaluations, websites, data dashboards, etc. Look especially for:

* “Granting” / “Community grants” / “Call for proposals” pages
  Examples to monitor:
* Vancouver Foundation – `https://www.vancouverfoundation.ca/`
* Toronto Foundation – `https://torontofoundation.ca/`
* Hamilton Community Foundation – `https://www.hamiltoncommunityfoundation.ca/`

---

### D. General procurement but small-project friendly

15. **Municipal / Regional tender portals**
    Smaller than provincial/federal, often with modest budgets.

Look for “Bids & Tenders,” “Procurement,” or “Purchasing” on:

* City of Toronto – `https://www.toronto.ca/` (search “tenders”)
* City of Hamilton – `https://www.hamilton.ca/` (search “bids and tenders”)
* Region of Waterloo – `https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/`

Most use either Bids&tenders or their own listing; once you find which system they use, you can subscribe centrally via that system.

---

### E. “Soft” RFP sources (informal but surprisingly good)

16. **LinkedIn search (posts)**
    Saved search for posts with keywords like:

* `("Request for Proposals" OR RFP) AND (nonprofit OR charity) AND (Canada OR Canadian)`
  Filter: *Posts* and *Companies in Canada*.

17. **Google search patterns**
    You can treat these as “pseudo-feeds” via Google Alerts later (next section):

* `"\"Request for Proposals\" \"non-profit\" site:.ca"`
* `"\"call for proposals\" \"charity\" site:.ca"`
* `"\"request for proposal\" \"website redesign\" site:.ca"`

---

## 2️⃣ Automation Workflow – No-Code / Low-Code

Let’s make this something you *check once*, and then just skim emails/feeds.

### Step 1 – Clarify your “sweet spot”

For automation filters and keywords, decide:

* **Budget range** (e.g. $5k–$75k)
* **Work type** (web redesign, membership portals, learning portals, digital transformation, evaluation/analytics)
* **Sector** (certification/professional bodies, education, health, community services)
* **Geography** (Canada-wide vs Ontario/BC heavy)

You’ll use those in your keyword filters and alerts.

---

### Step 2 – Email-based alerts from platforms

1. **CharityVillage**

   * Create a saved search for:

     * Job type: *Request for Proposal*
     * Location: Canada
   * Save it and enable email notifications (they support job search alerts). ([CharityVillage][1])

2. **Bids&Tenders**

   * Create a **vendor account**.
   * Pick commodity codes: “web development,” “information technology services,” “training services,” “consulting,” etc.
   * Turn on email notifications for new bids matching those codes. ([bids.bidsandtenders.ca][2])

3. **CanadaBuys**

   * Use Tender Opportunities search with filters:

     * Keywords (e.g. “website”, “portal”, “learning”, “evaluation”)
     * Region/province as needed.
   * Save and subscribe to notifications from CanadaBuys. ([CanadaBuys][3])

4. **Specific funders / United Ways**

   * For each site you care about (e.g. United Way GT, East Ontario, KFL&A, Vancouver Foundation, Toronto Foundation), do two things:

     * Subscribe to their **newsletter** (most announce calls for proposals there).
     * Bookmark or save the **funding/CFP page** for the automated script / RSS part later.

---

### Step 3 – Google Alerts for “wildcard” opportunities

Use Google Alerts with **weekly digest** to keep noise down:

Examples of alerts to create:

* `"request for proposals\" \"website\" \"non-profit\" site:.ca`
* `"call for proposals\" \"portal\" (\"association\" OR \"college\" OR \"institute\") site:.ca`
* `"\"Request for Proposals\" \"learning management\" OR \"e-learning\" site:.ca`
* `"\"Request for Proposals\" \"strategic planning\" nonprofit site:.ca` (for strategy/consulting bites)

Set frequency to **At most once a week**. Skim and star anything relevant.

---

### Step 4 – RSS + Feed Reader

Many NP/network sites run on WordPress or similar and already have RSS feeds. For each:

* Vantage Point / BCNN
* ONN
* CCVO / Nonprofit Chamber
* Your favourite United Ways & community foundations
* CharityVillage RFP tag feed (their blog/tag often has RSS) ([resources.charityvillage.com][14])

Feed setup:

1. Use a reader like **Feedly**, **Inoreader**, or **Reeder**.
2. Add feeds for:

   * “News” or “Blog” sections of NP networks.
   * “Funding” or “Call for proposals” pages (some have RSS out of the box; some don’t, but you can use a service like [rss.app]-style tools to generate a feed from a URL).

---

### Step 5 – LinkedIn saved searches

On LinkedIn:

1. Go to **Search → Posts**.
2. Use something like:

   * `("Request for Proposals" OR RFP) AND (nonprofit OR charity) AND (Canada OR Canadian)`
3. Hit “Create search alert”.

Now when a small NP just posts “We’ve issued an RFP for a new website…”, it shows up without you lurking constantly.

## 3️⃣ “Developer Mode”: A Simple Python RFP Monitor

Since you’re comfortable with Python/Django, you could:

### A. Create a small config file (YAML/JSON)

Example structure:

```yaml
sources:
  - name: "CharityVillage RFPs"
    url: "https://www.charityvillage.com/jobs/request-proposal/canada"
    pattern: "Request For Proposal"   # or a CSS selector
  - name: "United Way KFLA Funding"
    url: "https://www.unitedwaykfla.ca/funding/"
    pattern: "Call for Proposals"
  - name: "United Way East Ontario"
    url: "https://www.unitedwayeo.ca/"
    pattern: "Call for Proposals"
  - name: "Vantage Point News"
    url: "https://thevantagepoint.ca/"
    pattern: "call for proposals"
```

### B. Script outline (run via cron or GitHub Actions)

High-level flow:

1. Fetch each URL (with `requests`).
2. Parse HTML with `BeautifulSoup`.
3. Look for:

   * Headlines containing `RFP`, “Request for Proposals”, “Call for Proposals”.
   * Links whose text matches those patterns.
4. Compare to what you saw last run (store a simple hash or list of URLs in a JSON or SQLite file).
5. If there are *new* items:

   * Send yourself an email (e.g. via SMTP, or use a transactional provider).
   * Or push to a Google Sheet / Notion DB.

Even simpler: have it just print a Markdown summary and run it in GitHub Actions once a day that emails you the log.

---

## 4️⃣ Putting it all together (your “once-a-week RFP hour”)

Once this is set up, your weekly rhythm could be:

1. **Skim email alerts**

   * CharityVillage, Bids&Tenders, CanadaBuys, Google Alerts.
2. **Open your feed reader**

   * Check NP networks + funding pages you added via RSS.
3. **Glance at your script output** (if you build it)

   * Quick scan of the “New RFPs this week” list.
4. **Check LinkedIn saved searches**

   * 2–3 minutes of scrolling.

---

## 5️⃣ Next step I can help with

If you’d like, I can:

* Turn the above into a **ready-to-paste Google Sheet** structure (columns + example rows) for your RFP source tracker, **and/or**
* Draft a **minimal Python script skeleton** that:

  * Reads a YAML of sources
  * Checks for RFP-like patterns
  * Sends you a concise email in Markdown format

Tell me which you want first: **sheet template**, **script skeleton**, or **both** and I’ll draft them.
